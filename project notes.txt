	- what inspired the spy theme? where did the idea come from?
	- what do you envision the page looking like? art style, graphics
	- is your application something that would be provided through schools, or an individual project that parents must sign up for?
	- is the rank progression automatic, or would you make it so kids have to pass some kind of test to progress?
	- if you were to create a similar game in the future, what kind of theme would you pick? how would you do things differently?

3. mindfeast games
	- Would you prefer a website or an app to generate the files?
